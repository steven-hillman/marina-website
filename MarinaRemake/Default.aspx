                    Inland Marina was established in the 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created as a result of the South West damn. From 
                    its humble beginnings, it has grown to be the largest marina on Inland Lake. Due to the warm climate that extends 
                    year-round, Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in the south west.
